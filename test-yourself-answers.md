## Test Yourself: Answers

This is the file you'll use to add your answers to the [Test Yourself exercise](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/web-development-basics/getting-comfortable-with-git-and-the-command-line). You will add them via pull request.

### Instructions

See the [Web Development Basics project](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/web-development-basics/) for details.

Keep your answers under 3 paragraphs.  Replace the line that says *Your Explanation Here!* with your explanation and a link to your Github username.  See the example below.

The `.md` extension on this file means it's a markdown file.  You can just assume it's a text file with a bit of HTML-ish syntax.  If you'd like to read up more on markdown, which can be converted to HTML so you can add images or videos, check out the [documentation from Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).  You shouldn't have any problem copying the styles other people have used.

### Example Answer

#### Example Question

## All About Web Developers

#### What does a Web Developer do?

A web developer's job is very hands-on, and can vary wildly from person to person. Generally, a web developer's job involves a lot of planning, building websites or web apps from the ground up, deploying them, and maintaining them by fixing bugs or optimizing the code. 

In otherwords, a web developer plays the role of both an architect and handyman, but their work lives in the cloud.

#### What's the difference between web developers and web designers?

*Your explanation here!*

#### What's the difference between front end, back end, and full stack developers?

Front-end developers focus more on the actual webpage itself, how the site looks to the end user. Back-end devlopers focus on the server side code that runs the applicaiton, Usually they use programming languages like Python, Ruby, or Java. Full-Stack developers are responibile for both the front-end and back-end of the application. 

#### What's the difference between static and dynamic web pages?

Dynamic webpages change depending on the user input and actions. Static web pages offer no dynamic changes and keep their content no matter the actions of the end-user. 

#### What's the best way to get help when you get stuck?

The best bet to get help when you are stuck is to use google! There are other fantastic resources but google will give you great access to all of them. a lot of times you will find your answer turning up on StackExchange.

#### Where are the closest developer communities to you?

Montana Programmers is a great statewide organization that also has a lot of smaller meetups available from meetup.com. There is a weekly Ruby lunch in Missoula, Montana and several general programmer meetups and drinkups in the region.

#### What online developer communities can you join?

Start with IRC channels, subreddits, and various meetup groups in your specific area. 

#### Why is it better to use a developer-friendly text editor like Sublime Text than something oriented more towards word-processing like Microsoft Word?

Text editors like sublime are intuitive and dynamic in managing your text from a developers perspective. As a personal note the text editors are also much easier on your eyes as you are looking through code.

#### What are DNS servers?

A DNS server is a special kind of computer that links human-readable names of web sites, such as www.google.com, to their actual IP address location.

For example, instead of typing www.google.com and asking a DNS server to look-up the address of google for you, you can simply enter http://74.125.224.72/ directly into your browser!

#### What is HTML and how is it used?

Hypertext markup language, a language of tags used to define the structure and
content of Web pages, such as headings, lists, paragraphs, line breaks, images,
etc.

#### What is CSS and how is it used?

Cascading Stylesheets, a language that describes the look and style of the elements
defined in an HTML document, such as fonts, colors, spacing, transparency, alignment,
and other design aspects of a page. In short, it makes the raw information look pretty,
and it makes the front end simpler by separating presentation from content.

## The Command Line

#### What is the command line?

prevent unwanted access and/or modification of files. Permissions often are for read, write, execute?

#### What is a "Superuser" and how do you execute commands as this user?

The "Superuser" is a user of a computer system with special privileges needed to administer and maintain the system. Superuser commands can be executed using 'sudo' in the command line, which stands for Superuser do.

'sudo' allows a user to run programs with the security privileges of another user, often the superuser or root user.

*Your explanation here!*

#### Why might you need to add onto your `$PATH` variable?

#### What are alias commands?

Alias commands are shortcuts that can be set up for use with the command line. These are often set for convenience so things such as long scripts that are often repeated don't need to be fully typed out.

For instance, when using Sublime Text, one may not want to always manually locate files and open them using the application. Instead, an alias can be set such as 'subl' which can be used in the command line preceding the filename. This opens the file in sublime text, voila!

i.e. 'subl text.txt'

## Terms to Know

Define the following:

### The Web


#### URL( Uniform Resource Locator)

Address that one types in to reach a particular webpage.  Human readable address that eventually gets mapped through DNS into actual IP addresses.

#### API

API stands for Application Programming Interface, which is a set of programming instructions and standards for accessing a Web-based software application. Software companies typically release APIs to the public so that other software developers can design products that are powered by its service.

For example, Amazon.com released its API so that web developers could more easily access Amazon's product information. Using the Amazon API, a third-party website can post direct links to Amazon products with updated prices and product descriptions.

#### Web Server

*Your explanation here!*


#### Bugs

*Your explanation here!*


#### The Cloud

The cloud is simply another word for the internet. When backing up your files (such as music, pictures, and movies) on "the cloud" you are backing them up on servers that may potentially be far away from where you are. In short, your personal computer is considered "on the ground" while the remote storage servers located who-knows-where are "in the clouds."

#### Responsive Design

*Your explanation here!*


#### Grid System

*Your explanation here!*


#### RGB

Short for red, green and blue, the three colors that make up a pixel. Each is an integer between 0 and 255, and a combination of three integers specifies a color to display.

*Contributed by [Dan Berger](https://github.com/dsberger)*


#### Hex

Hexadecimal: a base-16 numeral system. Digits are 0-9, a-f. Example: Hexadecimal(1c) == Decimal(28). In the context of color, Hexadecimal is used to numerically represent Red, Green, and Blue content, using three pairs of digits. This allows 256^3 (over 16 million) unique colors. Color example: #00ff00 is Green.

#### Above the Fold

<<<<<<< HEAD
Content that is visible immediately when the page is loaded, without having to scroll. Good design will place important elements here so the site's visitors don't have to scroll to find content. A reference to olde-tymey newspaper formatting, where headlines would be placed prominently above the physical fold.

#### What is RVM and how will it be useful later?

RVM stands for Ruby Version Manager and is a command-line tool which allows you to easily install, manage, and work with multiple ruby environments from interpreters to sets of gems.

RVM is helpful because some gems, tools, and frameworks may only work with a particular version of Ruby. RVM lets you easily switch between different environments, based on needs, when developing.
