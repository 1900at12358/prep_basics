## Test Yourself: Answers

This is the file you'll use to add your answers to the [Test Yourself exercise](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/web-development-basics/getting-comfortable-with-git-and-the-command-line). You will add them via pull request.

### Instructions

See the [Web Development Basics project](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/web-development-basics/) for details.

Keep your answers under 3 paragraphs.  Replace the line that says *Your Explanation Here!* with your explanation and a link to your Github username.  See the example below.

The `.md` extension on this file means it's a markdown file.  You can just assume it's a text file with a bit of HTML-ish syntax.  If you'd like to read up more on markdown, which can be converted to HTML so you can add images or videos, check out the [documentation from Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).  You shouldn't have any problem copying the styles other people have used.

## All About Web Developers

#### What does a Web Developer do?

A web developer's job is very hands-on, and can vary wildly from person to person. Generally, a web developer's job involves a lot of planning, building websites or web apps from the ground up, deploying them, and maintaining them by fixing bugs or optimizing the code. 

In otherwords, a web developer plays the role of both an architect and handyman, but their work lives in the cloud.

#### What's the difference between web developers and web designers?

Web designers are focused on the artistic design and ux/ui of a website or web app, whereas developers are focused on how to build it, although there is some overlap between the two nowadays. 

#### What's the difference between front end, back end, and full stack developers?

Front-end developers focus more on the actual webpage itself, how the site looks to the end user. Back-end devlopers focus on the server side code that runs the applicaiton, Usually they use programming languages like Python, Ruby, or Java. Full-Stack developers are responibile for both the front-end and back-end of the application. 

#### What's the difference between static and dynamic web pages?

Dynamic webpages change depending on the user input and actions. Static web pages offer no dynamic changes and keep their content no matter the actions of the end-user. 

#### What's the best way to get help when you get stuck?

The best bet to get help when you are stuck is to use google! There are other fantastic resources but google will give you great access to all of them. a lot of times you will find your answer turning up on StackExchange.

#### Where are the closest developer communities to you?

Montana Programmers is a great statewide organization that also has a lot of smaller meetups available from meetup.com. There is a weekly Ruby lunch in Missoula, Montana and several general programmer meetups and drinkups in the region. 

*Contributed by [Nick Schwaderer](http://github.com/Schwad)*


#### What online developer communities can you join?

Start with IRC channels, subreddits, and various meetup groups in your specific area. 

#### Why is it better to use a developer-friendly text editor like Sublime Text than something oriented more towards word-processing like Microsoft Word?

Text editors like sublime are intuitive and dynamic in managing your text from a developers perspective. As a personal note the text editors are also much easier on your eyes as you are looking through code.

#### What are the top 3 characteristics of great web developers?

Curiosity/creativity - The passion for creating/building and the hunger for learning new technologies
Ability to think quickly and problem solve - Figuring out a soluition to a problem construct on your feet and easily is a hallmark of a great developer
Persistence - The developer world is fraught with obstacles and setbacks, but persistence will pave the way to success

#### What do companies look for in a junior web developer?

*Your explanation here!*

#### What is the hiring process like for a developer?

To apply for a job, you'll have to submit a resume, cover letter, links to your portfolio projects, and your Github page.  If the employer likes what they see, you will likely have a phone screen interview, through which the employer will get more information on your background and interest in the position (and also determine if you pass their baseline requirements).  If they bring you on-site, you will likely have a series of interviews, each with a different focus (behavior assessment, portfolio/code review, on-the-spot programming observation).  Every company's different, but this is the sort of application process I would prepare for!

## How the Web Works


#### What is the internet?

Simply put, the internet is a global system of interconnected computers and devices, all communicating with each other via a common language (or standard protocol).

*Contributed by [Daniel Au](https://github.com/dakmau)*


#### How is information broken down and sent?

It is broken down into packets and sent through random different ways to get to their destination.


#### What are packets?

Packets are bits of data that are parts of a whole that are sent from one computer or server to another. An image, video or some other asset is requested by a client and the host serves them up by breaking it down into smaller chunks called packets that are sent out with information attached to them that signifies where they are to be routed and how to piece them all back together.

*Contributed by [Dondi Fusco](https://github.com/dondi2112)*


#### What is a "client"?

*Your explanation here!*


#### What is a "server"?

*Your explanation here!*


#### What is HTTP and how does an HTTP request work?

HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, which is the standard method used to request and transmit data across the internet.  When a user enters a URL in their browser, the browser generates the HTTP request and sends it to the server, which also responds via HTTP to provides the data & files for the requested site.

*Contributed by [Adam Kinson](http://github.com/kinsona)*

#### What are DNS servers?

A DNS server is a special kind of computer that links human-readable names of web sites, such as www.google.com, to their actual IP address location.

For example, instead of typing www.google.com and asking a DNS server to look-up the address of google for you, you can simply enter http://74.125.224.72/ directly into your browser!

*Contributed by [Daniel Au](https://github.com/dakmau)*

#### What is HTML and how is it used?

Hypertext markup language, a language of tags used to define the structure and
content of Web pages, such as headings, lists, paragraphs, line breaks, images,
etc.
*Contributed by [Michael Alexander](http://github.com/betweenparentheses)*

#### What is CSS and how is it used?

Cascading Stylesheets, a language that describes the look and style of the elements
defined in an HTML document, such as fonts, colors, spacing, transparency, alignment,
and other design aspects of a page. In short, it makes the raw information look pretty,
and it makes the front end simpler by separating presentation from content.
*Contributed by [Michael Alexander](http://github.*com/betweenparentheses)*

#### What is your browser's Web Inspector (aka Developer Tools) and how can you use it to poke around in a page's HTML?

Developer Tools will show you the actual HTML and CSS that generated content on the page.  By hovering over items, you can see how they were defined in HTML, how they were styled in CSS, and any other relevant attributes.  You can open up the Developer Tools by right-clicking in the browser and selecting "Inspect Element."

*Contributed by [Adam Kinson](http://github.com/kinsona)*

The Web Inspector is a tool that allows you to view a web pageâ€™s source, the DOM hierarchy, debug Javascript, and more.

## The Command Line

#### What is the command line?

A terminal/shell that one opens and types in commands for various tasks (moving between directories, opening, editing files, removing files, changing settings and permissions, ,etc)
*Contributed by [Michelle Ho](http://github.com/michelleyho)*

#### How do you open it on your computer?

I open it using by pushing super and return. I created my own shortcut to which I thought would be efficent

#### What is Bash?

#### What is a "Superuser" and how do you execute commands as this user?

The "Superuser" is a user of a computer system with special privileges needed to administer and maintain the system. Superuser commands can be executed using 'sudo' in the command line, which stands for Superuser do.

'sudo' allows a user to run programs with the security privileges of another user, often the superuser or root user.

#### What is the `.bash_profile` file and what is it used for?

The bash '.bash_profile' file is a startup file for the bash shell and is used for many things such as declaring the $PATH variable for login shells.
*Contributed by [Jason Barkley](https://github.com/jbarkl3y)*

#### What is the `$PATH` variable?

The $PATH variable is an environmental variable in the GNU/Linux and other UNIX-like operating systems that tells _shell_ which directories to search for *executable files* in response to commands issued by a user.

$PATH dictates the locations within a file tree that contains commands executable within a command line setting

#### Why might you need to add onto your `$PATH` variable?

*Your explanation here!*

#### What are alias commands?

Alias commands are shortcuts that can be set up for use with the command line. These are often set for convenience so things such as long scripts that are often repeated don't need to be fully typed out.

For instance, when using Sublime Text, one may not want to always manually locate files and open them using the application. Instead, an alias can be set such as 'subl' which can be used in the command line preceding the filename. This opens the file in sublime text, voila!

i.e. 'subl text.txt'

## Terms to Know

Define the following:

### The Web


#### URL( Uniform Resource Locator)

Address that one types in to reach a particular webpage.  Human readable address that eventually gets mapped through DNS into actual IP addresses.
*Contributed by [Michelle Ho](http://github.com/michelleyho)*


#### Domain

*Your explanation here!*


#### IP Address

IP addresses are the absolute address of a website. Four number ranging from 0 to 255 and separated by commas, these are unique but difficult to remember for the everday user - hence the creation of URLs and the DNS.

*Contributed by [Malcolm Reddoch](http://github.com/mreddoch)*

A specific and unique numeric signifier of a networked entity; can be an appliance, computer, phone, etc. 

*Contributed by [Dondi Fusco](https://github.com/dondi2112)*


#### DNS

The Domain Name System, or DNS, is the phone book of the Internet. It takes human-readable URLs and translates them to IP addresses so that packets know exactly where to go.

#### HTTP

*Your explanation here!*


#### HTTPS

*Your explanation here!*


#### POP & IMAP & SMTP

*Your explanation here!*


#### API

API stands for Application Programming Interface, which is a set of programming instructions and standards for accessing a Web-based software application. Software companies typically release APIs to the public so that other software developers can design products that are powered by its service.

For example, Amazon.com released its API so that web developers could more easily access Amazon's product information. Using the Amazon API, a third-party website can post direct links to Amazon products with updated prices and product descriptions.

#### The Cloud

The cloud is simply another word for the internet. When backing up your files (such as music, pictures, and movies) on "the cloud" you are backing them up on servers that may potentially be far away from where you are. In short, your personal computer is considered "on the ground" while the remote storage servers located who-knows-where are "in the clouds."

#### 404 Error

The frustrating page a user receives when the specific page he or she was hoping to access doesn't exist. Can be made less frustrating if it is accompanied by a clever joke, or a picture of a kitten.

*Contributed by [Malcolm Reddoch](http://github.com/mreddoch)*

Nasty error when a page is not found when requested that the hosting domain alerts the user/requester with.

### Design


#### WYSIWYG

"What you see is what you get". Often a GUI interface where the changes you make in your editor are nearly identical (in theory) to the changes you will see on your page.

#### Responsive Design

*Your explanation here!*


#### Grid System

#### RGB

Short for red, green and blue, the three colors that make up a pixel. Each is an integer between 0 and 255, and a combination of three integers specifies a color to display.

*Contributed by [Dan Berger](https://github.com/dsberger)*


#### Hex

Hexadecimal: a base-16 numeral system. Digits are 0-9, a-f. Example: Hexadecimal(1c) == Decimal(28). In the context of color, Hexadecimal is used to numerically represent Red, Green, and Blue content, using three pairs of digits. This allows 256^3 (over 16 million) unique colors. Color example: #00ff00 is Green.

*Contributed by [Andur Carr](https://github.com/LaMarseillaise)*


#### Above the Fold

<<<<<<< HEAD
Content that is visible immediately when the page is loaded, without having to scroll. Good design will place important elements here so the site's visitors don't have to scroll to find content. A reference to olde-tymey newspaper formatting, where headlines would be placed prominently above the physical fold.

#### How do you merge branches back together?

In order to merge branches back together you should merge the master branch into your-branch

$git checkout your-branch
$git merge master

Resolve any conflicts that occur. Move back to your master branch and merge your-branch into the master branch.

$git checkout master
$git merge your-branch

You'll see output indicating any changes that were made

#### What is a "Merge Conflict" and when will it occur?

A merge conflict occurs during a merge when the same part of some file has changed in the two different branches. For example, let's say John and Jane are working on a project together. John creates a branch for a feature he is working on. While he is working on this branch, he modifies a file that Jane has also modified on the master branch. When John attempts to merge the master branch into his feature branch, he'll receive a message that the automatic merge failed and that the conflicts need to be fixed and the changes committed.
